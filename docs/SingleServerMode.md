# Single Server Mode

InodeDB supports running a single server to serve collections for testing or prototyping  purposes, while the cluster mode works for production environments.

The single server mode has no replication/distribution so does not provide reliability, high availability or scalability. 

However, it implements the same functional API as the cluster mode.
